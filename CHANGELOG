*** ORIGINAL AEWM CHANGELOG ***

1.1.2:

 * Rewrote init_position again. This fixes the problem with specifying a USPosition containing 0.
 * Added gtk-menu client contributed by Adam Sampson <azz@gnu.org>. I want to fold this stuff into the rest of the goodies eventually. For now, just keep in mind that the extensions to .paletterc may change.
 * Added a "-version" option for printing version information from the command line.
 * Added some proper headers to all the files in goodies/lib/.
 * Replaced strcpy/strcat in panel-misc.c with snprintf to prevent a possible buffer overflow.
 * Made some improvements to the .paletterc parser: squish a possible segfault, handle comments/blank lines, ignore menu directives.
 * Reformatted man pages.

1.1.1:

 * Fix typo in man page install location.
 * Use -lXt when compiling Xaw goodies (required to build on SunOS).
 * Added some more documentation (mostly about things that are likely to break.)

1.1.0:

 * Xft (freetype extension) support, thanks once again to help from Adam Sampson <azz@gnu.org>.
 * A few Makefile improvements: only link against required libraries, easier enabling/disabling of options, don't attempt to compile against headers in the binary destination tree.
 * Yet more init_position tweaks -- use x position hint even if y is out of range and vice versa, and take window gravity into account when positioning.
 * Some additions and improvements to the debug code (mainly printing names of constants instead of cryptic numbers).

1.0.3:

 * Backport new init_position, -version option, new man pages, and panel-misc.c crasher/overflow fixes.

1.0.2:

 * Backport -lXt fix and new documentation.

1.0.1:

 * Fix remove_client so that it compiles with -DDEBUG turned on.

1.0.0:

 * All right, I think we're stable now. New stuff will go into 1.1.x.
 * Changed init_position so that it doesn't cut off very large windows. This was merely annoying for regular windows, but it was downright buggy for incsized ones.
 * Fixed compilation bug when shape support was disabled.

0.9.19:

 * OK, I broke command line parsing again. Yes, I'm an idiot.
 * Fixed problem with exec()-ing a non-existent program.

0.9.18:

 * Fixed bug in init_position; we can safely use PPosition now. If windows start popping up in bad places, check their size hints before yelling at me.
 * Use fork/exec instead of system(3) to run programs. Fixed signal handlers to reflect this (we need POSIX sigaction(2)).
 * Cleaned up MWM hints/WM_SIZE hints code (they sort of match now), and only request the MWM atom at startup instead of for each call.
 * Started yet another goodies reorganization, and ended up reverting a lot of it. However what's changed should go a little ways towards cleaning things up.
 * Fix a build error where some goodies files that needed to be compiled against X were compiled without -I/use/X11R6/lib, failing on systems without a symlink from /usr/include/X11.
 * Tossed out historical 'iheight' junk in border calculation.

0.9.17:

 * Use ln -f to ignore overwriting previously installed manpage links.
 * If MWM hints are enabled, no-border windows will no longer get a border upon exiting.
 * The order of buttons in *-palette is no longer changed by title updates or unhiding windows.
 * xaw-palette was fixed to work with proper versions of Xaw (shame on me for testing with Xaw3d!), including the one in XF4. The new internals have ported over to gtk-palette.

0.9.16:

 * Fixed a shaping bug (which actually existed before changes made in 0.9.15) where a window that used to be shaped, but then became unshaped, wasn't updated properly.
 * MWM hints support can now be compiled in with -DMWM_HINTS, thanks to help from Adam Sampson <azz@gnu.org>.
 * Set the input focus upon entering a window frame, instead of on entering the child window.

0.9.15:

 * Display a titlebar for shaped windows. This also makes the bug where shaped windows were getting gravitated as if they had a titlebar irrelevant.
 * Tiny cleanups for the Debian package, including:
 * Man page for the goodies.
 * Typo in makefile fixed (tried to strip manpage, ah-reer-reer-reer).
 * Polished the main man page a bit.

0.9.14:

 * Free cursors and GCs in quit_nicely.
 * Switch order of objects and libraries in Makefile to placate Solaris cc.
 * Rename raise to raise_win -- raise is in signal.h of course (duh!)
 * Added copyright notice to all goodies and Makefiles due to someone ignoring my license (this has been worked out).
 * Bail out on lack of default font. You *should* be reading aewm.h first of course ;-)

0.9.13:

 * Fix really stupid thing I did while refactoring make_new_client, where a window that started as Withdrawn would stay that way instead of getting mapped.
 * Deal with withdrawing clients properly in *-palette, by watching for the WM_STATE property to be changed instead of looking at UnmapNotify events.

0.9.12:

 * Clean up clients on receipt of a DestroyNotify. This is needed when a client is already unmapped (i.e, the user iconified it) and it exits.
 * Preserve window stacking order on exit and restart.
 * Mucked about with the make_new_client logic; tell me if this breaks something.
 * Added gtk-*-menu clients contributed by Adam Sampson <azz@gnu.org>.

0.9.11:

 * Got rid of unneeded PropertyChangeMask on root window. Silly me.
 * Removed the ugly array/linked-list hack from xaw-palette, so that the internal workings of both palette clients are now basically identical.
 * static'd everything that should have been static.
 * Updated email, documentation, etc.
 * Got rid of handle_reparent_event, as a client call to XReparentWindow is taken care of by handle_unmap_event.
 * Backed out the 0.9.9 change to option-parsing macros, which were causing all options to fail miserably (argh).

0.9.10:

 * Handle withdrawing windows properly in xaw-palette. Both palette clients are a little saner now.
 * Updated goodies docs.
 * ungravitate when printing geometry for move/resize.
 * Moved more code from individual goodies to common-run.c.
 * Got rid of unhide() as we never use it.
 * Replaced GenericWidget typedef silliness with global variables. sometimes you just have to pick the lesser of two evils...

0.9.9:

 * Finally de-insanified handle_xerror. Instead of going through contortions in remove_client to avoid raising errors, we turn the error handler off during the server grab.
 * Both palette goodies now track iconification of clients and WM_NAME changes.
 * gtk-palette is now oriented horizontally, and includes a menu, providing lots more space for client buttons.
 * Made the parse_option macros reusable (thanks to the comp.lang.c folks for the reminder).
 * make sure get_wm_name in the goodies doesn't crash for windows that have no name.
 * Minor typo corrections and stuff.

0.9.8:

 * Brown paper bag: take debugging stupidity out of gtk-palette.
 * Overhaul the goodies' build system yet again.
 * Gtk-palette now gets the screen size correctly.
 * All switch/palette goodies now cut off long titles, use WM_NAME instead of WM_ICON_NAME, and place iconified titles in parenthesis.
 * No changes to aewm itself in this release.

0.9.7:

 * Added lots of comments.
 * General code cleanups, tweaks, reformats all over.
 * Fixed iconic state problem.
 * Plugged a memory leak in send_wm_delete.
 * Added -new3.
 * Fixed -new[123] allocation bug.
 * Made debug code considerably saner.
 * Print "80x25" and such when resizing xterms.
 * Replaced sprintf with snprintf.
 * Got rid of -display. set DISPLAY in your environment instead, so that it propagates to child processes.
 * Messed around with the goodies' build system.
 * Fixed gtk-palette; events are now filtered properly at the GDK level.
 * Replaced variable length arrays with malloc/free.
 * Added xsession, since I've been using it forever.

0.9.6:

 * Fix for handling inital window geometry.
 * A few memory leaks plugged.
 * Wrote a man page
 * More consistent borders for transient windows.

0.9.5:

 * Print window geometry while moving/resizing.
 * Added some WM_NORMAL_HINTS sanity checks
 * Set the keyboard focus on window enter (for rxvt, etc).

0.9.4:

 * Root menu replaced by another client.
 * Added -bw option.
 * Border-drawing fixes (only visible if you have very wide borders).
 * Got rid of mouse button exit.

0.9.3:

 * Put the root menu code back in.
 * Added more goodies and reorganized them.

0.9.2:

 * Minor ICCCM compliance fix regarding WM_STATE.

0.9.1:

 * A small fix to make the palette complain if no rc file exists.

0.9:

 * Initial public release. Before this, aewm was called 'swim' and was used by me as a school project. It was also rather unstable.
