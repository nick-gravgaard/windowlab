windowlab \- a window manager for X11

.B windowlab \fI[options...]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B windowlab
is a small and simple window manager of novel design.
.PP
It's click-to-focus, shares its window depth policy with the Amiga, and has a window resizing/reshaping method similar to that of 8-1/2 from Plan 9. WindowLab maintains the illusion of direct manipulation by constraining the mouse pointer when appropriate, ie when a window cannot be dragged any further in one direction. The pointer is also constrained vertically (effectively making the target menu items infinitely tall according to Fitts's law) when it's in the menubar to reduce pointing time.
.PP
WindowLab places a taskbar at the top of the screen and adds a bar to the top of each window. These bars consist of a draggable area, and three squares on the right hand side. From right to left, these squares close the window, toggle the windows Z order Amiga style (if it's not at the front, bring it to the front, otherwise send it to the back), and start a reshape action (after clicking the gadget, move the mouse to where you want the top-left hand corner of the window to be, and drag the mouse to set the bottom-right corner). Window titlebars must always be fully on-screen and cannot overlap the taskbar at the top of the screen (so if you want to get rid of a window quickly and don't want to send it to the back you should drag it downwards).
.PP
The taskbar should list all windows currently in use. Clicking on a windows taskbar item will give that window focus and act as a click on that windows middle-gadget - ie toggle that windows Z order (depth).
.PP
If you right click outside a client window, WindowLabs taskbar becomes a menubar. Releasing the right mouse button over a selected menu item will start a corresponding external program. The menu labels and commands are defined in either ~/.windowlab/menurc or /etc/X11/windowlab/menurc if the first file cannot be opened.
.PP
An example menurc file is included (menurc.sample). Each line in the menurc file should have the menu label, a colon, and then the corresponding command, ie:

.PP
WindowLab positions new windows according to the coordinates of the mouse - the top-left hand corner of a new window is set to the location of the mouse pointer (WindowLab will move the window if necessary to ensure that all of the new windowbar is fully on-screen).
